This course introduces principles of decision making under uncertainty from both a prescriptive (i.e. how to choose a 
course of action ?) and a descriptive standpoint (i.e. why a given course of action was chosen ?). The course material 
includes: axiomatic representation of preferences and expected utility models, attitudes towards risk, different sources
of bias (e.g. framing, confirmation, loss aversion), introduction to Bayesian inference and learning.
