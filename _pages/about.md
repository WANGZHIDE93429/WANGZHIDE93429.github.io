# 👋🏻 Hi there, I am Zhide!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Texas A&M University. 

## Research interests
Methodologically, I study structural modeling and estimation of dynamic decision making under uncertianty for both single agent case (see my paper [Structural Estimation of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9931903)) and multi-agent (i.e., game) case.

Empirically, I apply my models to 

- The study retail investment under business cycle (see my paper [Retail Investment under Hidden Business Cycle](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4754439)).

  

  🔑 *keywords: Aggregate Fluctuations; Firm Investment; Industry Dynamics; Learning Models; Market Power; Retail Competition and Strategy; Partially Observable Stochastic Games.*

  

- Individual decision making under different cognitive status (see my paper [The effects of mental fatigue on effort allocation: Modeling and estimation.](https://psycnet.apa.org/journals/rev/129/6/1457/)).

  

  🔑 *keywords: mental fatigue, effort allocation.*



## ⏭️ Coming up...

- I will be presenting my work on retail investment at TPM conference 

	⏰ May 16-18, 2024

	📍The University of Texas at Austin’s McCombs School of Business
